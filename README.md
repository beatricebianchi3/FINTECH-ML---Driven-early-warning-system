# FINTECH: ML-Driven Early Warning System
This repository contains the code for a fintech project aimed at developping an **Early Warning System** for market anomaly detection, such as market crashes.

Indeed, one of the main concerns for investors is the market's tendency to crash, since it can lead to significant financial losses. Hence, being able to detect such crashes early on provides several key benefits:
* **Risk management**: EWS help investors and fund managers to take preemptive actions, such as diversifying portfolios, selling off risky assets, or hedging against potential losses;
* **Fraud detection**: Market anomalies can indicate fraudulent activities or market manipulation. Early detection can prevent significant financial crimes and protect the integrity of the market; 
* **Enhance market and operational efficiency**: Early detection of anomalies contributes to market efficiency by providing timely information, leading to better resource allocation and more strategic decision-making;
* **Customer trust**: EWS can boost investors' confidence by safeguarding their financial assets and personal information.

In this project, an EWS is built after a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of various machine learning classification methods, namely Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.\
The complete implementation of these models can be found in the project's respective _Jupyter notebooks_.

# Methodology

## Data overview
The dataset, sourced from Bloomberg, consists of 22-year (2000-2021) weekly data on key equity indices, bond indices, short/medium/long term interest rates, exchange rates, commodities, leading indicators (Economic surprise, Baltic Dry Index) and VIX (option implied volatility).

## Data pre-processing
Missing values in the dataset are removed in order to prevent negative impacts on the output quality.\
Next, features are standardized using _StandardScaler()_ to ensure comparability.\
Finally, data is split into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets to ensure robust model evaluation and selection.

## Feature Engineering
Given the advantage of having _prior knowledge_ on the features, data has been divided into **4 buckets**: Bonds, Equities, Commodities and Indexes. Each bucket is studied independently, and the optimal methods for each are included in the final **ensemble model** used for predictions.  

This approach is mainly driven by the several **gains** that could derive from it:
* **Tailored analysis**: Since each bucket represents a distinct financial market segment with unique characteristics and behaviors, the model can leverage domain-specific insights that are more relevant to each type of asset;
* **Complexity reduction**: By breaking the dataset into buckets, models can focus on a narrower scope of features, leading to more straightforward patterns and relationships;
* **Robustness**: Ensemble methods aggregate the predictions from multiple models, leading to more robust and reliable outcomes, potentially reducing the impact of any single modelâ€™s weaknesses.

## Evaluation Metrics
To determine the best model for market anomaly detection, we focused on 3 key metrics:

* **Recall**: Measures the ability to identify all actual crashes, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing all relevant anomalies;
* **Precision**: Measures the truthfulness of positive predictions, crucial for minimizing false alarms;
* **Accuracy**: Provides an overall measure of the model's performance by considering both true positives and true negatives.

## Stacking
To enhance our evaluation metrics, we employ a Stacking method, a popular ensemble technique in machine learning. Stacking involves combining multiple weak learners in a parallel manner, and then using a **meta-learner** to integrate their outputs, resulting in improved predictive results.

In this project, the meta-learner takes the outputs of the best-performing models from each of the four buckets as input and learns how to best combine their strengths to optimize the final prediction performance.

Specifically, **Logistic Regression** is chosen as the meta-learner for several reasons:
* **Probability Scores**: Probability outputs are particularly useful in EWS, since they can be interpreted as the likelihood of a market crash, allowing for a more nuanced decision-making process rather than a binary output;
* **Interpretability**: Logistic Regression's simplicity allows for clear insights into how each feature contributes to the prediction, which is crucial in financial contexts, where decisions need to be explainable to stakeholders;
* **Computational Efficiency**: Logistic regression is computationally efficient, making it feasible to train and update regularly with new data, which is important in dynamic financial markets;
* **Scalability**: It can handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring scalability as the volume of financial data grows over time.

The effectiveness of the Logistic Regression model is assessed using the test set, determining its capability in detecting market anomalies.
